The project used the dataset provided by Analytics Vidhya to train the model and predicts whether an individual will get promoted or not based on previous performance and various other factors. The dataset consisted of some missing values which were dealt with using regression analysis on other factors and an extensive exploratory data analysis was performed. The model was trained and saved using Keras and Tensorflow to get a training accuracy of 93.89%, test accuracy of 91.7% and an F1 score of 0.57
